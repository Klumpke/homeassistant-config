# The calendar component allows you to integrate your calendars into Home Assistant.

# The google calendar platform allows you to connect to your Google Calendars
# and generate binary sensors. The sensors created can trigger based on any event
# on the calendar or only for matching events. When you first setup this component 
# it will generate a new configuration file google_calendars.yaml that will contain 
# information about all of the calendars you can see.
